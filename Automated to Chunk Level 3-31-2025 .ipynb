      "First, some designers and scientists have created chainmail structures to produce\n",
      "ﬂexible fabrics, but comfort is still the biggest problem, and there are not many fashion\n",
      "companies that produce garments using 3DP technology. Due to the limit of raw materials,\n",
      "it is hard to achieve pore structures and air permeability such as that of traditional textiles.\n",
      "Therefore, developing new raw materials similar to natural ﬁbers or soft fabric structure is\n",
      "highly desirable. In addition, most 3D-printed wearable garments are currently limited\n",
      "to art pieces or haute couture. These garments involve complex geometric designs and\n",
      "special vivid effects, which always take a long time to produce. It is necessary to design\n",
      "some garments with a low cost that are suitable for daily life. Third, there have been few\n",
      "performance tests of 3DP textiles (e.g., draping, breathability and tensile strength) carried\n",
      "out in previous studies and the uniﬁed test standard is also lacking, so the capacities and\n",
      "characteristics of different 3DP textiles are difﬁcult to compare. Therefore, a consensus test\n",
      "method for 3D-printed textile-based structures should be considered.\n",
      "With the development of 3DP technology and deepening of research, we believe that\n",
      "more materials can be used for 3D printing, and that fabric with comfort and softness can\n",
      "be produced and will be extended in more functional applications.\n",

      "overseeing the sample stages. This is further supported by evidence from \n",
      "Sinha (2002, 5) that designers become less involved with manual sample \n",
      "making as the size of the company increases, focusing more on gathering \n",
      "and applying market and trend data to current styles. Gwilt (2011, 63) \n",
      "also noted that where large-scale manufacturing occurs, the designer \n",
      "is involved at the research and concept stages only, and is unlikely to \n",

      "outside design and sample production limits designers within standard \n",

      "take on a highly centralized role, in which they either directly oversee \n",
      "or actively perform all duties from sourcing, design and production, \n",

      "and the day-to-day running of the business.\n",
      "Key design insights in the upcycling process include the technique \n",
      "of “patchwork” pattern cutting, which enables the best use of set \n",
      "quantities of fabric. Limited supplies of key colors or prints can be \n",
      "used to accent designs through creative design and pattern cutting. This \n",
      "technique of cutting also allows greater flexibility in the substitution \n",
      "of fabrics into designs, meaning designers are able to make full use of \n",

      "sustainable design strategy of “design for waste minimization”.\n",
      "Promotion\n",
      "The results from the interviews with upcycling designers demonstrated \n",

      "The results show social media to be a key element in each upcycling \n",
      "brands’ promotional strategy; directly involving interested customers \n",
      "in the brand through the opportunity to leave feedback and comments, \n",
      "corresponding to “design for user participation”. A definite design \n",

      "The advantage of this lies in raising the profile of the brand and making \n",

      "Brands 1 and 3 both already use their own versions of this modular \n",
      "system, in which makers are responsible for specific garments or parts \n",

      "Insights provided by the model in Figure 8, Standard design vs. \n",

      "design and production processes. For multiples of consistent designs to \n",
      "be possible, it is necessary for designers to have accurate information \n",
      "about what materials are available and in ready supply, by purchasing \n",
      "these fabrics nearer to the start of the process (Cassidy and Han 2012, \n",

      "production planning.\n",
      "Key design insights include the technique of “patchwork” pattern \n",

      "not just through retailing fashion products, but by offering events and \n",
      "workshops, and communicating their ethos through social media.\n",
      "Upcycling designers are central to all these operations. In implementing \n",
      "sourcing at an early stage in the process, and directing designs to utilize \n",
      "set quantities of fabric stocks, it is possible to incorporate consumer \n",
      "preferences for style and value. Designers are also fulfilling sustainable \n",
      "design strategy criteria at each stage of the process. Implications \n",
      "suggested by these insights include strategies for more effective sourcing \n",
      "in upcycling as key for making the model operational. As sourcing \n",
      "is crucial for creating consistent multiples of designs, a network of \n",
      "information for designers outlining the location, quantity, quality and \n",
      "composition of source materials would enable a more effective and less \n",
      "time-consuming fashion upcycling process. This would also allow the \n",
      "implementation of large-scale upcycling as a new sustainable design \n",

      "The findings from this study demonstrate that there are significant \n",
      "differences between upcycled and standard fashion and design, \n",
      "production and research processes. For effective upcycled fashion design \n",
      "to occur, specific considerations need to be made as part of the design \n",

      "in the process than in standard design and production, and pattern \n",
      "cutting techniques must take into account inconsistencies in supply \n",
      "with interchangeable fabric options. It is necessary for information on \n",
      "the availability of source materials to be on hand from the outset, in \n",
      "order to achieve consistency of design throughout production.\n",
      "Design is directly informed by the available source materials, and \n",
      "often follows traditional techniques of drawn designs and sample \n",
      "making in seasonal collections. Adaptations for smaller pattern pieces, \n",
      "making up standardized designs, allow for greater flexibility in fabric \n",
      "and color combinations and substitutions. A technique or formula of \n",
      "“patchwork” pattern cutting is necessary to standardize designs to most \n",
      "efficiently utilize varying source materials in appealing designs.\n",
      "The benefits of upcycling include using waste as a source material, \n",
      "diverting it from landfill, and in doing so reducing carbon emissions \n",
      "and other negative environmental impacts. This creates a cost-\n",

      "Types of Floods and Floodplains \n",
      " \n",
      "Chapter Overview \n",
      "There are several different types of floods. Most communities experience only a few of them. \n",
      "Floods are generally grouped into the following types; \n",
      "∞ Riverine flooding \n",
      "∞ Urban drainage \n",
      "∞ Ground failures  \n",
      "∞ Fluctuating lake levels \n",
      "∞ Coastal flooding and erosion \n",
      " \n",
      "Within some of these groups there are several subtypes of floods. \n",
      " \n",
      "Surface Water Runoff  \n",
      "When rainfall reaches the Earth’s surface, water evaporates, infiltrates into the soil, or runs over the \n",
      "surface. The kinds of ground cover greatly influence the proportions of each of these actions. In \n",
      "various types of communities, and within communities, there are different cover types. For \n",
      "example, an urban area, like a city, might have these cover types: \n",
      "∞ Open space (lawns, golf courses, parks) generally covered with grass \n",
      "∞ Streets and roads \n",
      "∞ Paved parking lots, shopping centers, \n",
      "∞ Houses and residential areas \n",
      "∞ Offices and business areas \n",
      " \n",
      "If the rainfall intensity exceeds the evaporation rate and infiltration capacity of the soil, surface \n",
      "runoff occurs. It also occurs when rainfall falls on impervious surfaces, such as roadways and \n",
      "other paved areas. Water flows across the surface as either confined or unconfined flow. \n",
      "Unconfined flow moves in broad sheets of water often causing sheet erosion. It can also pick up \n",
      "and adsorb or carry contaminants from the surface. Water that flows along the surface may become \n",
      "trapped in depressions. Here water may either evaporate back into the air, infiltrate into the ground, \n",
      "or spill out of the depression as it fills. If local drainage conditions are inadequate to accommodate \n",
      "rainfall through a combination of evaporation, infiltration into the ground, and surface runoff, \n",
      "accumulation of water in certain areas may cause localized flooding problems.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Alternately, the sheet flow may reach a natural or constructed water conveyance system such as a \n",
      "swale, channel, or conduit. Water is conveyed to larger drainage systems such as creeks, streams \n",
      "and rivers. During winter and spring, accumulation of snow may increase water runoff generated \n",
      "by both precipitation and snowmelt.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Flooding problems resulting from runoff of surface water generally increase as areas become more \n",
      "urbanized. Greater population density generally increases the amount of impervious area, e.g., \n",
      "pavement and buildings. This reduction in the amount of natural ground that can absorb rainfall \n",
      "results in an increase in the amount of surface runoff generated. Uncontrolled, this runoff may be \n",
      "channeled to areas that cause flooding of structures and roadways. This may be especially true \n",
      "———Types of Floods and Floodplains——— \n",
      "2-2 \n",
      "where the predevelopment land surface had a gently sloping surface with no defined channels. \n",
      "Such areas are subject to shallow sheet flooding during storms, but urbanization and other \n",
      "development speeds the accumulation of floodwater. \n",
      " \n",
      "When surface water runoff introduced into streams and rivers exceeds the capacity of the natural or \n",
      "constructed channels to accommodate the flow, water overflows the stream banks, spilling out into \n",
      "adjacent low lying areas. Riverine flooding occurs as a consequence. \n",
      " \n",
      "Riverine Flooding \n",
      "The dynamics of riverine flooding vary with terrain. In relatively flat areas, land may stay covered \n",
      "with shallow, slow-moving floodwater for days or even weeks. In hilly and mountainous areas, \n",
      "floods may come minutes after a heavy rain. The short notice, large depths, and high velocities of \n",
      "flash floods make these types of floods particularly dangerous. Among the common types of \n",
      "riverine flooding are: \n",
      " \n",
      "Overbank Flooding \n",
      "Overbank flooding of rivers and streams – the increase in volume of water within a river channel \n",
      "and the overflow of water from the channel onto the adjacent floodplain – represents the classic \n",
      "flooding event that most people associate with the term “flood.”  In fact, this is also the most \n",
      "common type of flood event. Hundreds of riverine floods, great and small, occur annually in the \n",

      "Photograph of water everywhere—flooded subdivision. \n",

      "Riverine floodplains range from narrow, confined channels (as in steep river valleys in hilly and \n",
      "mountainous areas) to wide, flat areas (as in much of the Midwest and in many coastal areas). In \n",
      "the steep narrow valleys, flooding usually occurs quickly and is of short duration, but is likely to \n",
      "———Types of Floods and Floodplains——— \n",
      "2-3 \n",

      "more difficult to predict to provide useful \n",

      "Alluvial fans, which occur mainly in dry mountainous regions, are deposits of rock and soil that \n",
      "have eroded from mountainsides and accumulated on valley floors in a fan-shaped pattern. The \n",
      "deposits are narrow and steep at the head of the fan, broadening as they spread out onto the \n",

      "Fans provide attractive development sites due to their commanding views, but harbor severe \n",
      "flood hazards along with unique behavior.  Channels along fans are not well defined and flow \n",
      "paths are unpredictable. As rain runs off steep valley walls, it gains velocity, carrying large \n",
      "boulders and other debris. When the debris fills the runoff channels of the fan, floodwaters spill \n",

      "flooding due to the high velocity of water flow, the amount of debris carried, and the broad area \n",
      "affected by floodwaters. Floodwaters move at high velocities (15 to 30 feet per second are \n",
      "common) due to steep slopes and lack of vegetation. At these velocities, water has tremendous \n",

      "amounts of sediment and debris, including boulders and trees. Since floodwaters are not confined \n",
      "to a single channel, but travel through numerous meandering channels, developments over a \n",

      "Ice Jam Flooding \n",
      "Flooding caused by ice jams is similar to flash flooding – the formation of a jam results in a rapid \n",
      "rise of water both at the point of the jam and upstream. Failure of the jam results in sudden \n",
      "flooding downstream. This type of flooding is a problem in some 35 states. \n",
      " \n",
      "The formation of ice jams depends on both the weather and the physical conditions in the river \n",
      "channel. Flooding due to ice jams (or other ice conditions) can occur at different times and in \n",
      "different ways. Figure 2-3 illustrates areas where ice jams are most likely to occur. \n",
      " \n",
      "Flooding during fall freeze-up can result from the formation of frazil ice, which forms when \n",
      "temperatures drop but a swift current prevents the formation of a solid ice cover. The frazil ice \n",
      "floats downstream until it reaches a slower moving, frozen area and attaches itself to the underside \n",
      "of the ice cover (at times accumulating to form a hanging dam) or to the stream bed, forming \n",
      "anchor ice. \n",
      " \n",
      "Ice-related flooding also occurs during mid-winter periods of very low temperature when water in \n",
      "the stream channel freezes completely solid, forming anchor ice. Additional water coming down the \n",
      "stream freezes on top of the solid ice until and channel is blocked and the stream flows overland, \n",
      "flooding and freezing on adjacent lands. Solid ice formed in this way frequently blocks culverts. \n",
      " \n",
      "The classic ice jam occurs at spring breakup due to a combination of ice conditions. Generally, \n",
      "rising water levels in the river or stream resulting from snowmelt or rainfall break the existing ice \n",
      "cover into large, floating ice masses that lodge at bridges or other constrictions and create ice dams. \n",

      "Urban Drainage \n",
      "In an undeveloped area, the water runoff system is provided by nature. Some of the water remains \n",
      "where it falls, and evaporates; some is absorbed into the ground near the surface, and feeds trees \n",
      "and plants; some percolates deeply into the ground, and replenishes the groundwater supply. The \n",
      "remainder gradually or quickly collects into rivulets, accumulating both in quantity and speed as it \n",
      "hurries down the watershed through drainageways and streams to its ultimate destination – the \n",
      "river and then the sea, to begin the cycle again. (See Figure 1-1.) \n",
      " \n",
      "Even where urbanization has not occurred, nature’s inability to accommodate severe storms \n",
      "without significant damage is quite apparent. The natural drainage systems in an undeveloped area \n",
      "are not static in design, but are constantly changing. Streams change course, banks erode, \n",
      "vegetation and soil permeability change with seasons, water bodies fill with sediment and \n",
      "disappear. The stripping of vegetation and ground cover by fire may change an entire system, \n",
      "forcing new natural accommodations throughout the system. \n",
      " \n",
      "Urbanization has required new drainage systems because man was unwilling to suffer \n",
      "inconvenience caused by increased or previously un-experienced surface water runoff where it \n",
      "could be avoided. The basic philosophy of urban drainage has typically been to seek maximum \n",
      "convenience at an individual site by the most rapid possible elimination of excess surface water \n",
      "after a rainfall and the containment and disposal of that water as quickly as possible through a \n",
      "closed conveyance system. This has meant that no matter how large the rainfall or its duration, the \n",
      "drainage system is expected to remove runoff as quickly as possible. The cumulative effects of \n",
      "such an approach has been a major cause of increased frequency of downstream flooding, often \n",
      "accomplished by diminishing groundwater supplies, as direct results of urbanization; or have \n",
      "necessitated development of downstream measures to prevent flood damage \n",
      " \n",

      " \n",
      "Urban drainage (stormwater) management is comprised of both natural and man-made elements. \n",
      "The stormwater runoff system has two purposes: 1) the control of stormwater runoff to prevent or \n",
      "minimize damage to property and physical injury and loss of life which may occur during or after a \n",
      "very infrequent or unusual storm; and 2) the control of stormwater to eliminate or minimize \n",

      "improved “hydraulic efficiency” of the local drainage network. In other words, the time required \n",
      "for surface runoff to reach a stream channel is reduced. Unless the drainage network is specifically \n",

      "Ground Failures \n",

      "are the Appalachian region, the Rocky Mountain region, and the Pacific coast region. \n",
      " \n",
      "The National Academy of Sciences (National Research Council, 1985) has defined mudflood and \n",
      "mudflow as follows: \n",
      "∞ Mudflood: Refers to a flood in which the water carries heavy loads of sediment (as much as \n",
      "50% by volume) including coarse debris. Mudfloods typically occur in drainage channels \n",

      "mechanism is that of a flow having sufficient viscosity to support large boulders within a \n",
      "matrix of smaller sized particles. Mudflows may be confined to drainage channels or may \n",
      "occur unconfined on hill slopes. \n",
      " \n",
      "Mudflows and mudfloods are often the result of rain falling on terrain that has been denuded by \n",
      "forest fires and brush fires, and thus cannot retain runoff. In areas where ground cover has been \n",
      "removed, even small rains can cause mudflows and mudfloods. Steep lands with an identifiable \n",
      "subsoil layer of clay could break loose and start a mudflow when the clay layer becomes saturated. \n",
      "The most common mudlow resulting from slope failure in forested lands occurs about five to ten \n",
      "years after a major forest fire where established timber is killed. During the following years new \n",
      "growth is established. However, roots from the previous growth have deteriorated and the new \n",
      "roots are not strong enough to hold the soil from moving, thus starting a mudflow. \n",
      " \n",
      "Both mudflows and mudfloods start with moving water or a stationary mass of saturated soil. \n",
      "Mudfloods usually originate as sheet flow or as water flowing in drainage channels, rivers or \n",
      "streams, and pick up sediment and debris as they flow. Mudflows often originate as a mixture of \n",
      "stationary soil and water. When the mixture gets wet enough, it begins to move as a mass, either as \n",
      "a result of gravity or when triggered by an earthquake or sudden flow of debris laden water. \n",
      "Mudflows may also begin as clear-water flows but incorporate sediments and other debris from the \n",
      "stream channel or banks and “bulk up” to flows much larger than the clear-water flow before \n",

      "handling them has progressed, the problem continues to grow. In the last 30 years, the number of \n",
      "damaging landslides has increased, due largely to continuing urban expansion in areas of steeply \n",

      "Subsidence occurs in nearly all the states. Ground failure due to subsidence can result in increased \n",
      "flood damages for two main reasons. If the land surface is lowered it may be more frequently or \n",
      "more deeply flooded. In addition, subsidence can block or otherwise alter drainage patterns leading \n",
      "to deeper or unexpected flooding. \n",
      " \n",
      "Subsidence is the result of both natural processes and human activities. Natural causes include \n",
      "solution (karts topography), consolidation of subsurface materials (such as wetlands soils), and \n",
      "movements in the earth’s crust. Human activities, which accelerate the natural processes leading to \n",
      "subsidence, include mining, inadequate compaction of fill material during construction, and \n",
      "withdrawal of oil or water from subsurface deposits. Baytown, Texas, near Houston, is a classic \n",

      " \n",
      "Liquefaction  \n",
      "Although less common than subsidence, liquefaction is another type of ground failure that \n",
      "contributes to flood problems. Liquefaction can result in serious flooding of structures built on fill \n",
      "or saturated soils, as in portions of San Francisco and Anchorage. \n",
      " \n",
      "Liquefaction is triggered by earthquakes and occurs when seismic shock waves pass through \n",
      "unconsolidated and saturated soil, allowing the soil grains to move freely and pack more closely \n",
      "together. A soil structure with water in the pore spaces is transformed to groups of grains in a fluid \n",
      "matrix, and the load of the overlying soil and buildings is transferred from the soil grains to the \n",
      "pore water. If the pressure on the water causes it to drain away, the overlying soils and structures \n",
      "will sink or tilt. If the water cannot drain away, the water pressure rises. When the water pressure \n",
      "equals the downward pressure of the overlying strata and structures, the saturated soil layer will \n",
      "become liquid and flow. On steep slopes (greater than 3%) where the saturated layer is at or near \n",
      "the surface, soil, vegetation and debris can flow rapidly downslope with the liquefied material. \n",
      "These flow failures can result in the movement of materials for miles. On gentle slopes (0.3 to 3%) \n",

      "Coastal flooding and erosion are serious problems along much of the nation’s coasts, although the \n",
      "frequency and magnitude of flooding and the severity of the erosion vary considerably. They result \n",
      "from storm surges and wave actions. \n",
      " \n",
      "Storm surge is the increase in water surface elevation above normal tide levels due primarily to \n",
      "low barometric pressure and the piling up of waters in coastal areas as a result of wind action over \n",
      "a long stretch of open water. The low pressure inside a storm or hurricane’s eye creates suction like \n",
      "a straw, creating a dome of water near the center of the storm. In the deep ocean, this dome of \n",
      "water sinks and harmlessly flows away. But as a storm nears land, strong winds in the storm push \n",
      "this dome of water toward the shore, the rising sea floor blocks the water’s escape and it comes \n",
      "ahore as deadly storm surge. (See Figure 2-4.)  An intense hurricane can send a dome of water \n",
      "many miles wide and more than 25 feet deep barreling toward the shore as the storm hits land. \n",
      " \n",
      "Depending upon local topography, a storm surge may inundate only a small area (such as along \n",
      "sections of the Northeast and Northwest coasts) or may inundate coastal lands for a mile or more \n",
      "inland from the shoreline (as in many areas of the south Atlantic and Gulf coasts).  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Storm surge is usually estimated by subtracting the regular/astrological tide level from the observed \n",
      "storm tide. Typical storm surge heights range from several feet to more than 25 feet. The exact \n",
      "height of the storm surge and which coastal areas will be flooded depends on many factors, \n",
      "including the strength, intensity and speed of the hurricane or storm; the direction it is moving \n",
      "relative to the shoreline; how rapidly the sea floor is sloping along the shore; the shape of the \n",
      "———Types of Floods and Floodplains——— \n",
      "2-16 \n",
      "shoreline, and the astronomical tide. In general, storm surge is most damaging when it occurs along \n",
      "a shallow sloped shoreline, during high tide, in a highly populated and developed area with little or \n",
      "no natural buffers, such as barrier islands, coral reefs and coastal vegetation. Storm surge is also \n",
      "most damaging in the storm’s right front quadrant because the storm, its winds and ocean waves \n",
      "are all moving in an onshore direction due to the counter-clockwise rotation of hurricanes in the \n",
      "Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, to the left of the eye, ocean waves and sea-level rise are moving \n",
      "toward the shore, but the winds are blowing in an offshore direction, thur counteracting or \n",
      "moderating some of the effects of the storm surge. \n",
      " \n",
      "Storm surge causes sea levels to rise for a relatively short period of time (typically four to eight \n",
      "hours, though some areas may take much longer to recede to their pre-storm levels) – often \n",
      "resulting in extensive coastal flooding that can weaken or destroy coastal structures. By temporarily \n",
      "raising sea level, storm surge permits “dangerous and battering waves” and floating debris to \n",
      "access coastal areas and structures never conceived of nor built to withstand the punishing effets of \n",
      "ocean waves. It is these battering waves that cause most beach erosion and extensive damage to \n",

      " \n",
      "In addition to storm surge, wave action is an important aspect of coastal storms. Breaking waves \n",
      "at the shoreline become very destructive, causing damages to natural and manmade structures by \n",
      "hydrodynamic pressure, battering solid objects and scouring sand from around foundations. \n",
      "Components of wave action include wave set-up and wave run-up. Wave set-up is the \n",

      "transport of the water by wave action alone. Wave run-up is the action of a wave after it breaks and \n",

      "itself. Where vertical obstructions such as seawalls are present, wave run-up is translated into \n",
      "upward movement of the water. \n",
      " \n",
      "As waves move toward the shore, they encounter several obstacles. The first obstacle is the sloping \n",
      "bottom near the shoreline. When waves reach a water depth equal to about 1.3 times the wave \n",
      "height, the wave breaks. Breaking waves dissipate their energy by generating turbulance in the \n",
      "water and by transporting sediment lifted off the bottom and tossed around by the turbulent water. \n",
      "As the turbulent water travels forward, it expends most of its remaining energy as it rushed up the \n",
      "beach slope. The beach adjusts to changes in wave energy by changing its profile. Beach material is \n",
      "moved either seaward, creating an offshore berm, or landward, building up the beach. The beach is \n",
      "constantly adjusting to both wave energy and water level. \n",
      " \n",
      "Offshore berms built up by the natural action of waves serve to protect the beach from most storm \n",
      "waves. When major storms generate larger waves, the berm may be eroded and berm material \n",
      "carried offshore. With the protective value of the berm removed, large waves can overtop the \n",
      "beach. In severe storms such as hurricanes 50- to 100-foot wide dunes may disappear in only a \n",
      "few hours. Although the dunes and beach may eventually recover to their previous conditions, the \n",
      "process may require many years.   \n",
      "    \n",
      "While hurricanes are the most violent type of storm and receive the most attention, serious flooding \n",
      "and erosion problems are also caused by other coastal storms. In the Atlantic, extratropical storms \n",
      "that develop in mid-latitudes in the fall, winter and spring occur much more frequently than tropical \n",

      "1. Introduction\n",
      "Floods are generated by the interaction of various physical\n",
      "processes. These include hydrological pre-conditions (e.g. soil sat-\n",
      "uration, snow cover), meteorological conditions (e.g. amount,\n",
      "intensity and spatial distribution of precipitation), runoff genera-\n",
      "tion processes (e.g. inﬁltration and lateral runoff on hillslopes), as\n",
      "well as river routing (e.g. superposition of ﬂood waves). The com-\n",
      "bination of these physical controls may be important, especially at\n",
      "the regional scale (P10,000 km2), where ﬂooding can affect many\n",
      "sites simultaneously, whereas other sites remain unaffected (Merz\n",
      "and Blöschl, 2008a).\n",
      "Three main approaches exist to describe regional ﬂood events in\n",
      "terms of their spatio-temporal physical causes. They can be catego-\n",
      "rised into (1) ﬂood event description, (2) classiﬁcation into ﬂood\n",

      "tion patterns. Following (1), detailed descriptions on e.g. soil mois-\n",
      "ture conditions, snowmelt and spatio-temporal distribution of\n",
      "rainfall are provided by scientiﬁc case studies. Examples in Central\n",
      "Europe are studies on the Elbe ﬂood in August 2002 (Ulbrich et al.,\n",

domains seek to\\nminimise waste material while approaching the problem from very diﬀerent perspectives.', 'The\\nC&P research investigates the use of mathematical and computational techniques for\\nminimising material waste in the marker planning problem, while the ZWFD provides creative\\npattern making solutions for the same problem.', 'A systematic literature review was performed\\nbased on content and bibliometric analysis of 22 papers published in peer-reviewed journals\\nfrom 2010 until 2021.', 'The paper maps the research direction of both the C&P and ZWFD as an\\nopportunity to stimulate further research in the future encouraged by the integration of both\\nareas to address the zero-waste fashion designs’ manufacturability problem by incorporating\\nthe fashion design process with the C&P optimisation algorithm design process.', 'ARTICLE HISTORY\\nReceived 30 April 2021\\nAccepted 10 September\\n2021\\nKEYWORDS\\nZero-waste; fashion design;\\ncutting and packing; marker\\nplanning problem;\\nautomated markers\\n1.', 'Introduction\\nWith the emergence of fast fashion and the increasing\\nrates of fashion consumption, the fashion industry’s\\nbusiness models shifted towards cost reduction methods\\nand techniques while ignoring essential factors such as\\nthe environmental cost of the fashion industry (Niini-\\nmäki & Hassi, 2011).', 'Fashion designers are beginning\\nto challenge the system’s linearity and seeking to pre-\\nvent waste through the elimination of fabric waste\\nduring the cutting stage of garment manufacture.', 'This paper reviews two research paradigms dealing\\nwith eliminating fabric waste during the cutting stage\\nof a garment.', 'The ﬁrst, Cutting and Packing (C&P) in\\nthe ﬁeld of Operational Research (OR), develops com-\\nputational methods for the cutting problem.', 'The C&P\\nresearch has contributed to the design of automated\\nmarkers for software providers such as Lectra by using\\ndiﬀerent optimisation algorithms and artiﬁcial intelli-\\ngence to minimise fabric waste during the cutting stage.', 'The other research paradigm is the Zero-Waste\\nFashion Design (ZWFD) which challenged traditional\\nfashion design principles to eliminate fabric waste to\\n0%.', 'However, most developed methods achieved mini-\\nmal waste rather than zero-waste due to the diﬀerent\\nvariables aﬀecting the design decision making process.', 'Automated markers still do not utilise 100% of the fab-\\nric and are not designed to accommodate the zero-waste\\ndesign practices, making it challenging for zero-waste\\ndesigners to use available software as part of the design\\nprocess and thus incorporate speed and eﬃciency as\\nrequired by industry.', 'The fabric waste generated in\\nthe cutting stage of fabric is estimated to be almost\\n15% of the total fabric used in manufacturing.', 'Even\\nthough there are some eﬀorts for waste management\\nthrough the use of fabric leftover, the problem remains\\ndue to the mismatch between the investment required to\\nmanage fabric waste and the value of leftovers which can\\ncome at a cost to the manufacturer (WRAP, 2019).', 'To the best of our knowledge, no literature provides a\\nconnection between the C&P and the ZWFD research\\nareas, even though both research areas aim to eliminate\\nfabric waste.', 'The relationship between both areas oﬀers\\nan opportunity for examining how to incorporate zero-\\nwaste fashion design principles into automated markers\\nwith the potential for industrial application.', 'The review\\naims to integrate the knowledge from zero-waste fashion\\ndesign research and the C&P research.', 'This integration\\nwill allow future research in C&P to improve marker\\nautomation and provide a ﬂexible system tailored to\\nZWFD thinking, not only traditional fashion design.', '© 2022 The Author(s).', 'Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &

research area\\nin the OR community that addresses operational pro-\\nblems associated with the utilisation of space or\\nmaterial.', 'In manufacturing industries that require cut-\\nting of materials such as textile, glass, leather, metal\\nand ceramics, research focuses on computational\\nmethods for automated cutting plans to increase pro-\\nductivity and material eﬃciency.', 'When targeting any\\noperational problem, the OR approach begins with\\ndeveloping a precise articulation of the problem’s\\ncharacteristics, constraints, and objectives, which may\\nrequire some assumptions or simpliﬁcations.', 'As a result,\\na quite messy problem becomes closer to a puzzle.', 'One of the research applications in the C&P commu-\\nnity is cutting textiles for garment manufacturing

overlap between the pattern pieces\\nand all patternpiecesarecontained within the boundary of\\nthe strip (Wäscher, Haußner, & Schumann, 2007).', 'The markers or pattern pieces are often represented\\nas irregularly shaped polygons; the fabric roll has a\\nﬁxed width and is a long enough strip to contain all pat-\\ntern pieces.', 'To solve this problem, a decision procedure\\nis constructed in the form of an optimisation algorithm\\ndesigned to ﬁnd the best possible solution based on the\\nproblem input and the speciﬁed objective, i.e.', 'no over-\\nlap and containment.', 'Two key strands of research deal with the problem: the\\nﬁrst is how to computationally model the geometric\\naspect of the problem so a computer can eﬃciently ident-\\nify feasible arrangements of shapes; the second is how to\\ncreate good layouts given the inﬁnite number of possible\\nconﬁgurations.', 'The diﬀerent computational geometry\\nmethods for the former are reviewed in Bennell and Oli-\\nveira (2008).', 'For the latter, there is a wide range of search\\nalgorithms applied; see Bennell and Oliveira (2009).', 'Over the years, C&P research has seen methodologi-\\ncal improvements and more powerful computers, which\\nhas improved marker automation.', 'Even though the pro-\\nblem deﬁnition in C&P has many commonalities with\\nreal-world applications, there are also many lost oppor-\\ntunities due to some signiﬁcant diﬀerences between how\\nC&P researchers approach the fabric minimisation pro-\\nblem and how practitioners in the garment industry\\ntackle the problem.', 'Even though each industry has its\\nproblem speciﬁcation based on the nature of the raw\\nmaterial used and other industrial constraints.', 'The\\nC&P community approach nesting problems from\\ndiﬀerent industries with similar solution methods and\\napproaches because the end goal is the same, which is\\nto nest the pieces in the smallest space possible.', 'To\\nthe best of our knowledge, papers covering the marker\\nplanning/nesting\\nproblems\\nare\\nrarely\\nfocused\\non\\nspeciﬁc industrial constraints and rarely challenge the\\nstatic nature of the problem deﬁnition.', 'One of the main limitations facing operational\\nresearch is ignoring the ﬂexibility in the problem con-\\nstraints.', 'This pragmatism would require human inter-\\nvention to adjust the shapes and orientation.', 'Such\\nthat, in solving the marker planning problem, diﬀerent\\nsolution methods and techniques are primarily based\\non trial and error.', 'Techniques that provide good sol-\\nutions

38(3)\\nauthors also found that engaging in the whole design process was ultimately satisfying and con-\\ncluded that this experimentation was valuable not only for reasons of sustainability but also

zero-waste\\npatterns as grading patterns for production was limited.', 'Carrico and Kim (2014) additionally crit-\\nicized that “in an effort to eliminate scrap fabric waste, excess fabric may remain within the garment\\nunnecessarily” (p. 63).', 'Cho and Lee (2015) examined jigsaw puzzle, subtraction cutting, and layer methods as zero-\\nwaste fashion design.', 'The three methods were evaluated by two categories, creativity (creation\\nability, idea visualization, and sense of aesthetics) and design integration (comprehension, analytic\\nthinking, and user consideration).', 'The authors assessed the difficulty level based on comprehension,\\napplication, and accessibility.', 'While the layer method was considered the most manageable (easy-\\nto-use) technique, the subtraction cutting and jigsaw puzzle methods were considered unfamiliar and\\nless approachable.', 'Cho and Lee (2015) found that once students were exposed to these techniques,\\nthey were willing to expand their usage of the techniques and that their awareness of their role in\\neliminating textile waste increased.', 'ZWPC limitations.', 'While previous researchers indicated that working within a zero-waste design\\napproach reinforces a different way of thinking and thus fosters creativity (Rissanen & McQuillan,\\n2016), they also enumerated some limitations and challenges of practicing zero-waste fashion\\ndesign.', 'As consideration of textile width is crucial in zero-waste fashion design (Rissanen, 2013),\\n“changes in fabrics later in the process could have significant implications on design and time\\nmanagement of the process” (James et al., 2016, p. 144).', 'In addition, “the unpredictability of pattern\\nshapes is the primary obstacle to eliminating fabric waste” (Rissanen, 2005, p. 3), and the final look\\nis not completely predictable before production is finished (Carrico & Kim, 2014).', 'Another chal-\\nlenge defined by Saeidi and Wimberley (2018) is that zero-waste fashion design is more time-\\nconsuming than the conventional fashion design process for reducing waste of resources, and some\\nzero-waste fashion design methods (e.g., tessellation) require significant mathematical work and\\ncalculation.', 'However, even with these limitations, teaching zero-waste fashion design will be\\nworthy as there will be positive outcomes from students understanding the effective use of resources\\nto realize sustainability within the complexity of the fashion industry.', 'Teaching Procedure\\nKnowledge of the patternmaking process is a crucial competency in the apparel industry; therefore,\\nfashion design programs contain a variety of product development and patternmaking courses.', 'In\\nthis study’s product development and patternmaking courses, however, sustainability practices were\\nnot addressed as learning objectives.', 'As a result, sustainability themes had not previously been\\nintroduced into either course through direct instruction or assigned projects.', 'The purpose of this\\nstudy was to develop and evaluate class projects that incorporated the zero-waste design concept in\\ntwo levels of existing design courses

waste (Rissanen, 2013), but employing zero-waste design can significantly\\nreduce the loss of fabric at the design stage.', 'It was also noted at this stage that a zero-waste design\\nproject can be a “creative patternmaking challenge by uniting the roles of designer and pattern\\nmaking in a holistic approach to creating garments, considering aesthetics and function\\nsimultaneously” (Carrico & Kim, 2014, p. 58).', 'This newer perspective on design would help\\nstudents develop creativity while considering sustainability.', 'Ideas were generated in Stage 2 of the project development,

wanted to evaluate feedback from\\nstudents with beginning sewing skills.', 'The second selected course was patternmaking, chosen\\nbecause students were focused on developing design competencies and had more advanced skills\\nto apply creative concepts to designs.', 'In both courses, students learned how to work with patterns.', 'Students in product development used commercial patterns, while patternmaking students used\\npatterns they made themselves.', 'In the third stage of project development, the framework was built by writing the actual assignments\\nthat students would use to learn zero-waste design (Larmer et al., 2015).', 'With consideration for\\nestablished course learning outcomes and semester schedules, it was determined that the project should\\nfit into two or three class periods and should provide students the opportunity to apply knowledge and\\nskills that they previously learned in that class.', 'Projects amounted to approximately 10% of students’\\noverall grade in each course and were assessed based on learning outcomes for each course.', 'Each project started with an introductory lecture that addressed current problems in the fashion\\nindustry, including the amount of waste generated.', 'Discussions of pre- and postconsumer waste\\nand fast fashion were provided as justification for the project.', 'Various approaches to zero-waste\\ndesign were also discussed.', 'Each project was geared to the level of skill students had reached in\\neach course at the time the zero-waste design project was initiated.', 'Instructors also

selected by considering the\\nproject duration and difficulty.', 'Project Implementation\\nThe zero-waste design project was introduced in two fashion courses: product development and\\npatternmaking.', 'Product development is a required course for both fashion design and fashion\\nmerchandising students in the program and is a prerequisite for a senior-level apparel product\\nanalysis course required of all students.', 'Product development is also a prerequisite for the pattern-\\nmaking course.', 'Projects for the semester-long course include a sample book of sewing skills, a\\nbelow-the-waist garment such as a skirt, and an above-the-waist garment such as a tailored shirt or\\nunlined jacket.', 'The zero-waste design project was implemented after students

'Additionally, we found there were differences in terms of students liking the projects and their\\ninterest in sustainable living and fashion between the two different course levels.', 'Finally, while\\nzero-waste design projects can be introduced in different levels of design courses, it is suggested\\nthat implementing these projects in patternmaking courses, when students have gained more\\nfashion design skills, could be more effective.', 'Students said they liked the idea of zero-waste\\ndesign, its creativity, and its unique silhouette, but they did not like it in terms of fit and flexibility\\nin creating different sizes.', 'Students also indicated little choice in style variety and tailoring as\\nlimitations of the zero-waste approach.', 'Students complained about the unpredictability throughout\\nthe zero-waste design process, a finding supported by Carrico and Kim (2014), who said, “The\\nprocess of creating zero-waste garments is unpredictable while also providing a tremendous\\ndesign challenge” (p. 63).', 'Some students indicated that the project was challenging for them.', 'The\\ndifferences in feedback could be due to the varying abilities and motivation levels of the students\\n(Jollands & Parthasarathy, 2013).', 'Also, “understanding the complexity of sustainable fashion\\nissues can be overwhelming and a barrier for fashion designers” (Kozlowski et al., 2019, p. 1).', 'Townsend and Mills (2013) pointed out that familiarity with conventional cutting methods could\\nbe a challenge when learning zero-waste design.', 'Ellmers (2017) suggested that letting students\\n“draw generalizations from their projects supports them to connect thinking about their projects\\nwith thinking about practices” (p. 77).', 'Limitations and Future Research Directions\\nWhile students agreed that the zero-waste design project helped them to consider sustainable design,\\ntheir answers for approaches to reducing fabric waste were not significantly changed (e.g., effective\\npattern placement, saving scraps for future use).', 'Thus, future researchers may implement different\\nzero-waste fashion design methods (e.g., jigsaw puzzle method) into project development for\\nencouraging students to implement creative solutions.', 'Students’ style preferences also affected their\\nproject experience (e.g., if students liked loose and comfortable styles, they were more likely to\\nenjoy the zero-waste design project).', 'Selecting styles through discussion with students or giving\\nmore style options to students and allowing them to select their preference is recommended, but this\\noption could require more instructional preparation.', 'Jollands and Parthasarathy (2013) suggested that “the most effective pedagogy for students to\\nlearn about sustainable development was a community-based project with collaboration of multiple\\nlearners as well as use of a constructive-learning pedagogy” (p. 5053).', 'Eike et al.', '(2018)

that implements a zero-waste design approach is recommended.', 'The projects developed in this study had more impact on students’ enhanced consciousness\\ntoward generating fabric waste than increasing their awareness about the negative impact from\\nfashion to environment.', 'A future study should address the limitation by developing and evaluating\\nprojects encouraging student awareness of these issues.', 'In addition, the projects developed and\\nimplemented in this study were based on the institutions’ established curriculum, which did not\\ninclude sustainability components.', 'Institutions that have implemented sustainability components\\ninto curriculum, particularly specific courses on sustainable design (which may even include con-\\ncepts such as zero-waste design), could share their own best practices with other universities.', 'Another limitation of this study is the assessment method.', 'This study used students’ own assess-\\nment of their work (PjBL).', 'According to Benett (1993), “Students have their own conceptualization\\nof supervised work experience and their conceptualization imposes a structure on their experience\\nand on how they make sense of it” (p. 86).', 'However, Benett (1993) also stated that “The validity of\\nstudents’ self-assessments of their performance at the workplace depends on whether students have\\ninternalized these standards (and the underpinning values) and are able to assess their performance\\nagainst these ‘objective’ criteria and standards” (p. 85).', 'When the project was introduced, current\\nproblems in the fashion industry were explained and discussed with students as project justification,\\nand it is hoped that students for this study understood the objective of the project.', 'Finally, questions\\nused in this study were not from theory-driven studies; thus, measures were not tested for validity\\nand did not report reliability.', 'Although we attempted to overcome the limitation of using students’\\nself-reporting as assessment and developing questions from nonvalidated scales, adding other\\nassessment methods such as comparing project grades, utilizing standardized tests to evaluate\\nstudents’ increased knowledge and awareness, or examining whether the zero-waste project could\\nenhance students’ creativity or spatial visualization skills are suggested for future researchers.', 'Measuring longitudinal impact would be equally valuable.', 'Conclusion\\nAchieving an increased number of sustainable apparel products will require new ways of thinking\\nabout design.', 'Zero-waste design is an option that emphasizes creativity to create solutions.', 'Based on\\nthis study, we suggest that educating students about sustainable design options influences positive\\nchanges in incorporating sustainable practices.', 'Developing a new sustainable fashion design course\\ncould be an ideal solution of teaching sustainability to current fashion design students.', 'However,\\nincluding one more course in the current curriculum may not be realistic for many programs.', 'Therefore, we developed zero-waste design projects in existing fashion

sketching is a process of draping a\\nfabric on an human form (mannequin) and continuously\\nadjusting on the form until the final look is decided.', 'In this\\nprocess, a designer will have different results by adjusting\\nand cutting the fabric to create a final look.', 'However, the\\ndesigner also needs to consider the amount of cutting in the\\nfollowing process to avoid having more fabric waste than\\n15% to meet the criteria of being zero waste.', 'When the\\nfinal look is decided, the fabric is taken of from the human\\nform (mannequin) after certain marking are made to help\\nthe pattern cutting process.', 'In the zero waste fashion design\\nconcept, patterns are not made with drafting papers, but\\nwith the final draped fabric, thus eliminating waste from\\nwide and long drafted patterns on papers and its cutting\\nwaste.', 'This process is known as pattern cutting and marker\\nmaking, which continues to be sewn as a toile (prototype).', 'Most designers will consider using the actual fabric rather\\nthan the muslin, to further eliminate waste.', 'Furthermore, by\\nusing the actual fabric, the designer is allowed to closely\\nobserve the flow, drape, and fall of the fabric on a human\\nform (mannequin) and have a better result in the final prod-\\nuct.', '1.3 Creative Pattern Cutting in Zero Waste Fashion\\nCreative pattern cutting is an approach on how to apply\\nthe zero waste fashion design concept in creating a garment.', 'Instead of the conventional process as mentioned by\\n[6]Rissanen (2013), creative pattern cutting is a flexible\\nmethod that allows designer to alter, manipulate, or com-\\nbine the basic principles of pattern making method, such as\\ncontouring, added fullness, and dart manipulation [7] (Arm-\\nstrong, 2010).', 'Furthermore, designers could choose to work\\nwith a flat pattern cutting method or draping or combine\\nboth technique, which is also the sketching process, as ex-\\nplained in the zero waste fashion design approach [8] (Ris-\\nsanen, 2013).', 'Figure 6.', 'Draping Technique Directly on Human Form (Mannequin)\\nSource: Onuma (2009)\\n6th Bandung Creative Movement International Conference in Creative Industries 2019 (6th BCM 2019)\\nDraping, traditionally, was a process of having a fabric\\non a human form and making adjustments to create a certain\\nshape.', 'The result is often uncertain due to the fact that hu-\\nman cannot control  the drape, flow, and fall of the fabric\\ndue to gravity and characteristic of the fabric.', 'However, in\\ncreative pattern cutting, draping can be controlled process\\nwith certain results as explained by [9] Onuma (2009) by\\nmarking or mapping the form to create style lines before\\ndraping the fabric.', 'The cutting process, such as bias, on\\nwarp, or on weft, of the grain direction in the fabric could\\nalso have different final results.', 'Another method that is frequently used as an alternative\\nto draping method in creative pattern cutting is flat pattern\\nmaking.', 'In the conventional process of garment making,\\nthis method is favored by designers in the ready to wear\\nindustry, due to its systematic working procedure for the\\ngarment manufacturing process.', 'To apply flat pattern mak-\\ning methods in creative pattern cutting, designers should\\nunderstand the grain direction of the fabric, its characteris-\\ntic, dimension, drape factor, and the shape of a basic bodice\\npattern.', 'Albeit the fundamental knowledge mentioned be-\\nfore, a designer is allowed to alter or manipulate the basic\\nbodice to a shape more suitable for the final design.', 'Geo-\\nmetric shape is commonly used to replace the basic bodice\\nshape in mapping the pattern directly on the fabric as seen\\non

'Floods are generally grouped into the following types; \\n∞ Riverine flooding \\n∞ Urban drainage \\n∞ Ground failures  \\n∞ Fluctuating lake levels \\n∞ Coastal flooding and erosion \\n \\nWithin some of these groups there are several subtypes of floods.', 'Surface Water Runoff  \\nWhen rainfall reaches the Earth’s surface, water evaporates, infiltrates into the soil, or runs over the \\nsurface.', 'The kinds of ground cover greatly influence the proportions of each of these actions.', 'In \\nvarious types of communities, and within communities, there are different cover types.', 'For \\nexample, an urban area, like a city, might have these cover types: \\n∞ Open space (lawns, golf courses, parks) generally covered with grass \\n∞ Streets and roads \\n∞ Paved parking lots, shopping centers, \\n∞ Houses and residential areas \\n∞ Offices and business areas \\n \\nIf the rainfall intensity exceeds the evaporation rate and infiltration capacity of the soil, surface \\nrunoff occurs.', 'It also occurs when rainfall falls on impervious surfaces, such as roadways and \\nother paved areas.', 'Water flows across the surface as either confined or unconfined flow.', 'Unconfined flow moves in broad sheets of water often causing sheet erosion.', 'It can also pick up \\nand adsorb or carry contaminants from the surface.', 'Water that flows along the surface may become \\ntrapped in depressions.', 'Here water may either evaporate back into the air, infiltrate into the ground, \\nor spill out of the depression as it fills.', 'If local drainage conditions are inadequate to accommodate \\nrainfall through a combination of evaporation, infiltration into the ground, and surface runoff, \\naccumulation of water in certain areas may cause localized flooding problems.', 'Alternately, the sheet flow may reach a natural or constructed water conveyance system such as a \\nswale, channel, or conduit.', 'Water is conveyed to larger drainage systems such as creeks, streams \\nand rivers.', 'During winter and spring, accumulation of snow may increase water runoff generated \\nby both precipitation and snowmelt.', 'Flooding problems resulting from runoff of surface water generally increase as areas become more \\nurbanized.', 'Greater population density generally increases the amount of impervious area, e.g., \\npavement and buildings.', 'This reduction in the amount of natural ground that can absorb rainfall \\nresults in an increase in the amount of surface runoff generated.', 'Uncontrolled, this runoff may be \\nchanneled to areas that cause flooding of structures and roadways.', 'This may be especially true \\n———Types of Floods and Floodplains——— \\n2-2 \\nwhere the predevelopment land surface had a gently sloping surface with no defined channels.', 'Such areas are subject to shallow sheet flooding during storms, but urbanization and other \\ndevelopment speeds the accumulation of floodwater.', 'When surface water runoff introduced into streams and rivers exceeds the capacity of the natural or \\nconstructed channels to accommodate the flow, water overflows the stream banks, spilling out into \\nadjacent low lying areas.', 'Riverine flooding occurs as a consequence.', 'Riverine Flooding \\nThe dynamics of riverine flooding vary with terrain.', 'In relatively flat areas, land may stay covered \\nwith shallow, slow-moving floodwater for days or even weeks.', 'In hilly and mountainous areas, \\nfloods may come minutes after a heavy rain.', 'The short notice, large depths, and high velocities of \\nflash floods make these types of floods particularly dangerous.', 'Among the common types of \\nriverine flooding are: \\n \\nOverbank Flooding \\nOverbank flooding of rivers and streams – the increase in volume of water within a river channel \\nand the overflow of water from the channel onto the adjacent floodplain – represents the classic \\nflooding event that most people associate with the term “flood.”  In fact, this is also the most \\ncommon type of flood event.', 'Hundreds of riverine floods, great and small, occur annually in the \\nUnited States.', 'Photograph of water

Midwest and in many coastal areas).', 'In \\nthe steep narrow valleys, flooding usually occurs quickly and is of short duration, but is likely to \\n———Types of Floods and Floodplains——— \\n2-3 \\nbe rapid and deep.', 'In relatively flat floodplains, areas may remain inundated for days or even \\nweeks, but floodwaters are typically slow-moving and shallow.', 'Photograph of mountainous

'Photograph of call to 911 to report flooding?', 'Flooding in large rivers usually results from \\nlarge-scale weather systems generating \\nprolonged rainfall over wide areas.', 'These same \\nweather systems may cause flooding in \\nhundreds of smaller basins that drain into the \\nmajor river system.', 'The streams and small rivers \\nare also susceptible to flooding from more \\nlocalized weather systems that cause intense \\nrainfall over only a small area.', 'In parts of the \\nnorthern and western United States, annual \\nspring floods result from spring snowmelt and \\nthe extent of flooding is dependent upon winter \\nsnowpack and spring weather patterns.', '———Types of Floods and Floodplains——— \\n2-4 \\nSeveral high-risk or unusual types of riverine flooding

failure, ice jam).', 'However, the \\nactual time threshold may vary in different parts of the country.', 'Ongoing flooding can intensify \\nto flash flooding in cases where intense rainfall results

inadequate dams and levees or to a flood that exceeds the design protection \\nlevel.', 'Many private or locally built levees and dams may provide only limited flood protection or \\nare sometimes poorly designed and maintained.', 'Many were built with no design standards.', 'Levee \\novertopping or failure typically occurs from floods beyond their capacity to handle, often with \\nspectacular and tragic results.', 'Dam failure can often be traced either to a poor decision made during design and construction or to \\ninadequate maintenance or operational mismanagement.', 'Failure may also result from natural \\nhazards, such as earthquakes, or from flow volumes that exceed capacity (Figure 2-1).', 'Damage \\n———Types of Floods and Floodplains——— \\n2-7 \\nfrom dam failure is

\\n———Types of Floods and Floodplains——— \\n2-8 \\n \\nAlluvial Fans  \\nAlluvial fans, which occur mainly in dry mountainous regions, are deposits of rock and soil that \\nhave eroded from mountainsides and accumulated on valley floors in a fan-shaped pattern.', 'The \\ndeposits are narrow and steep at the head of the fan, broadening as they spread out onto the \\nvalley floor.', 'Fans provide attractive development sites due to their commanding views, but harbor severe \\nflood hazards along with unique behavior.', 'Channels along fans are not well defined and flow \\npaths are unpredictable.', 'As rain runs off steep valley walls, it gains velocity, carrying large \\nboulders and other debris.', 'When the debris fills the runoff channels of the fan, floodwaters spill \\nout, spreading laterally and cutting new channels.', 'The process is then repeated, resulting in \\nshifting channels and combined erosion and flooding problems over a large area.', 'Photograph of “double jeopardy.” The Colorado River \\nis in the foreground; and an alluvial fan is in the background.', 'Like flash floods, flooding on alluvial fans can cause greater damage than typical riverine \\nflooding due to the high velocity of water flow, the amount of debris carried, and the broad area \\naffected by floodwaters.', 'Floodwaters move at high velocities (15 to 30 feet per second are \\ncommon) due to steep slopes and lack of vegetation.', 'At these velocities, water has tremendous \\nerosive force and damage potential.', 'In addition, floodwaters in alluvial fans contain large \\namounts of sediment and debris, including boulders and trees.', 'Since floodwaters are not confined \\nto a single channel, but travel through numerous meandering channels, developments over a \\nbroad area can be threatened.', 'During peak flow events, it is possible for water to reach any part \\nof the fan.', '———Types of Floods and Floodplains——— \\n2-9 \\nAlluvial fans are common in a number of western states and in Kentucky, Tennessee, and West \\nVirginia.', 'Spring City, Tennessee, lies near the base of a fan.', 'Figure 2-2 illustrates factors affecting flood hazards on alluvial fans.', 'Figure 2-2.', 'Factors affecting flood hazards on alluvial fans.', 'Ice Jam Flooding \\nFlooding caused by ice jams is similar to flash flooding – the formation of a jam results in a rapid \\nrise of water both at the point of the jam and upstream.', 'Failure of the jam results in sudden \\nflooding downstream.', 'This type of flooding is a problem in some 35 states.', 'The formation of ice jams depends on both the weather and the physical conditions in the river \\nchannel.', 'Flooding due to ice jams (or other ice conditions) can occur at different times and in \\ndifferent ways.', 'Figure 2-3 illustrates areas where ice jams are most likely to occur.', 'Flooding during fall freeze-up can result from the formation of frazil ice, which forms when \\ntemperatures drop but a swift current prevents the formation of a solid ice cover.', 'The frazil ice \\nfloats downstream until it reaches a slower moving, frozen area and attaches itself to the underside \\nof the ice cover (at times accumulating to form a hanging dam) or to the stream bed, forming \\nanchor ice.', 'Ice-related flooding also occurs during mid-winter periods of very low temperature when water in \\nthe stream channel freezes completely solid, forming anchor ice.', 'Additional water coming down the \\nstream freezes on top of the solid ice until and channel is blocked and the stream flows overland, \\nflooding and freezing on adjacent lands.', 'Solid ice formed in this way frequently blocks culverts.', 'The classic ice jam occurs at spring breakup due to a combination of ice conditions.', 'Generally, \\nrising water levels in the river or stream resulting from snowmelt or rainfall break the existing ice \\ncover into large, floating ice masses that lodge at bridges or other constrictions and create ice dams.', 'Rapid flooding may occur, first upstream, then downstream as the mass of ice and water finally \\n———Types of Floods and Floodplains——— \\n2-10 \\nbreaks free.', 'Huge ice masses moving downstream can shear off trees and destroy buildings above \\nthe level of the floodwaters.', 'Floating ice masses and their associated damages also occur in lakes.', 'Photograph of ice jam flooding.', 'As with other types of unique flood situations, damages from ice jam flooding usually exceed \\nthose of clear water flooding.', 'Flood elevations are usually higher than predicted for free flow \\nconditions, and water levels upstream and downstream increase rapidly.', 'Figure 2-3.', 'Likely ice jam areas.', '———Types of Floods and Floodplains——— \\n2-11 \\n \\nMoveable Bed Streams  \\nMovement of streambeds is most common where steep slopes and the lack of vegetation result in a \\nlot of erosion.', 'During a flood, a new channel may be created by erosion or an existing channel may \\nfill in with sediment.', 'Moveable bed streams are most common in mountainous areas.', 'Urban Drainage \\nIn an undeveloped area, the water runoff system is provided by nature.', 'Some of the water remains \\nwhere it falls, and evaporates; some is absorbed into the ground near the surface, and feeds trees \\nand plants; some percolates deeply into the ground, and replenishes the groundwater supply.', 'The \\nremainder gradually or quickly collects into rivulets, accumulating both in quantity and speed as it \\nhurries down the watershed through drainageways and streams to its ultimate destination – the \\nriver and then the sea, to begin the cycle again.', '(See Figure 1-1.)', 'Even where urbanization has not occurred, nature’s inability to accommodate severe storms \\nwithout significant damage is quite apparent.', 'The natural drainage systems in an undeveloped area \\nare not static in design, but are constantly changing.', 'Streams change course, banks erode, \\nvegetation and soil permeability change with seasons, water bodies fill with sediment and \\ndisappear.', 'The stripping of vegetation and ground cover by fire may change an entire system, \\nforcing new natural accommodations throughout the system.', 'Urbanization has required new drainage systems because man was unwilling to suffer \\ninconvenience caused by increased or previously un-experienced surface water runoff where it \\ncould be avoided.', 'The basic philosophy of urban drainage has typically been to seek maximum \\nconvenience at an individual site by the most rapid possible elimination of excess surface water \\nafter a rainfall and the containment and disposal of that water as quickly as possible through a \\nclosed conveyance system.', 'This has meant that no matter how large the rainfall or its duration, the \\ndrainage system is expected to remove runoff as quickly as possible.', 'The cumulative effects of \\nsuch an approach has been a major cause of increased frequency of downstream flooding, often \\naccomplished by diminishing groundwater supplies, as direct results of urbanization; or have \\nnecessitated development of downstream measures to prevent flood damage \\n \\nControlling and regulating urban runoff is called “stormwater management.” It is typically \\nconducted on a street by street, even a building by building, basis.', 'Urban drainage (stormwater) management is comprised of both natural and man-made elements.', 'The stormwater runoff system has two purposes: 1) the control of stormwater runoff to prevent or \\nminimize damage to property and physical injury and loss of life which may occur during or after a \\nvery infrequent or unusual storm; and 2) the control of stormwater to eliminate or minimize \\ninconvenience or disruption of activity as a result of runoff from more frequently occurring, less \\nsignificant storms.', '———Types of Floods and Floodplains——— \\n2-12 \\n \\nPhotograph of stormwater management technique.', 'The straightening and lining of channels; the construction of streets, curbs, and stormwater inlets; \\nsewers and other underground conduits; culverts; and other means of controlling runoff; result in \\nimproved “hydraulic efficiency” of the local drainage network.', 'In other words, the time required \\nfor surface runoff to reach a stream channel is reduced.', 'Unless the drainage network is specifically \\ndesigned to counteract this increase in rate of runoff from the watershed, the result is likely to be an \\nincrease in flood peaks.', 'Thus flooding will happen more quickly and usually to greater depths than \\nbefore urban development occurred.', 'Around 20-25 percent of all economic losses resulting from \\nflooding occur in areas not designated as being in a “floodplain,” but as a consequence of urban \\ndrainage.', 'Ground Failures \\nFlooding and flood-related erosion can result from several types of ground failures.', 'Subsidence \\nand liquefaction of soil may cause flooding of areas in the immediate vicinity of the ground failure, \\nwhile mudflows and mudfloods may cause damages downstream or downslope of the location \\nwhere the initial ground failure occurred.', 'Mudflood and Mudflows \\nMudflow and mudfloods (also referred to as debris flow) are considered a subset of landslides and \\naffect many of the nation’s floodplains.', 'Areas that have experienced the greatest landslide damage \\nare the Appalachian region, the Rocky Mountain region, and the Pacific coast region.', 'The National Academy of Sciences (National Research Council, 1985) has defined mudflood and \\nmudflow as follows: \\n∞ Mudflood: Refers to a flood in which the water carries heavy loads of sediment (as much as \\n50% by volume) including coarse debris.', 'Mudfloods typically occur in drainage channels \\n———Types of Floods and Floodplains——— \\n2-13 \\nand on alluvial fans adjacent to mountainous areas, although they may occur on floodplains \\nas well.', '∞ Mudflow: Refers to a specific subset of landslides where the dominant transporting \\nmechanism is that of a flow having sufficient viscosity to support large boulders within a \\nmatrix of smaller sized particles.', 'Mudflows may be confined to drainage channels or may \\noccur unconfined on hill slopes.', 'Mudflows and mudfloods are often the result of rain falling on terrain that has been denuded by \\nforest fires and brush fires, and thus cannot retain runoff.', 'In areas where ground cover has been \\nremoved, even small rains can cause mudflows and mudfloods.', 'Steep lands with an identifiable \\nsubsoil layer of clay could break loose and start a mudflow when the clay layer becomes saturated.', 'The most common mudlow resulting from slope failure in forested lands occurs about five to ten \\nyears after a major forest fire where established timber is killed.', 'During the following years new \\ngrowth is established.', 'However, roots from the previous growth have deteriorated and the new \\nroots are not strong enough to hold the soil from moving, thus starting a mudflow.', 'Both mudflows and mudfloods start with moving water or a stationary mass of saturated soil.', 'Mudfloods usually originate as sheet flow or as water flowing in drainage channels, rivers or \\nstreams, and pick up sediment and debris as they flow.', 'Mudflows often originate as a mixture of \\nstationary soil and water.', 'When the mixture gets wet enough, it begins to move as a mass, either as \\na result of gravity or when triggered by an earthquake or sudden flow of debris laden water.', 'Mudflows may also begin as clear-water flows but incorporate sediments and other debris from the \\nstream channel or banks and “bulk up” to flows much larger than the clear-water flow before \\neventually dropping the debris and attenuating.', 'Mudflows may travel many miles from their \\nsource.', 'Mudflood resulting from eruption of Mt.', 'St. Helens.', 'Mudflows and mudfloods may cause more severe damage than clear water flooding due to the \\nforce of the debris-filled water and the combination of debris and sediment.', 'The force of the water \\noften destroys pilings and other protective works, as well as structures in its path (or when \\nstructures remain intact, sediment must often be physically removed with shovels or hoses).', 'Mud \\nand debris may also fill drainage channels and sediment basins, causing floodwater to suddenly \\ninundate areas outside of the floodplain.', '———Types of Floods and Floodplains——— \\n2-14 \\nAlthough understanding of the causes of landslides and the development of improved methods for \\nhandling them has progressed, the problem continues to grow.', 'In the last 30 years, the number of \\ndamaging landslides has increased, due largely to continuing urban expansion in areas of steeply \\nsloping terrain and unstable slopes.', 'This urban development alters hillslope configuration and \\nupsets established equilibrium conditions, affecting the natural instability of many slopes and, in \\nsome cases, reactivating older landslides.', 'Subsidence \\nSubsidence is a type of ground failure that can lower the ground surface, causing or increasing \\nflood damage in areas of high ground water, tides, storm surges or over bank stream flow.', 'Subsidence occurs in nearly all the states.', 'Ground failure due to subsidence can result in increased \\nflood damages for two main reasons.', 'If the land surface is lowered it may be more frequently or \\nmore deeply flooded.', 'In addition, subsidence can block or otherwise alter drainage patterns leading \\nto deeper or unexpected flooding.', 'Subsidence is the result of both natural processes and human activities.', 'Natural causes include \\nsolution (karts topography), consolidation of subsurface materials (such as wetlands soils), and \\nmovements in the earth’s crust.', 'Human activities, which accelerate the natural processes leading to \\nsubsidence, include mining, inadequate compaction of fill material during construction, and \\nwithdrawal of oil or water from subsurface deposits.', 'Baytown, Texas, near Houston, is a classic \\nexample of a local flood problems greatly aggravated by subsidence resulting from the latter \\nsituation.', 'Liquefaction  \\nAlthough less common than subsidence, liquefaction is another type of ground failure that \\ncontributes to flood problems.', 'Liquefaction can result in serious flooding of structures built on fill \\nor saturated soils, as in portions of San Francisco and Anchorage.', 'Liquefaction is triggered by earthquakes and occurs when seismic shock waves pass through \\nunconsolidated and saturated soil, allowing the soil grains to move freely and pack more closely \\ntogether.', 'A soil structure with water in the pore spaces is transformed to groups of grains in a fluid \\nmatrix, and the load of the overlying soil and buildings is transferred from the soil grains to the \\npore water.', 'If the pressure on the water causes it to drain away, the overlying soils and structures \\nwill sink or tilt.', 'If the water cannot drain away, the water pressure rises.', 'When the water pressure \\nequals the downward pressure of the overlying strata and structures, the saturated soil layer will \\nbecome liquid and flow.', 'On steep slopes (greater than 3%) where the saturated layer is at or near \\nthe surface, soil, vegetation and debris can flow rapidly downslope with the liquefied material.', 'These flow failures can result in the movement of materials for miles.', 'On gentle slopes (0.3 to 3%) \\nwhere the saturated layer is below the surface, failures termed lateral speed occur, with huge blocks \\nof soil moving 10 to 100 feet or more.', 'Fluctuating Lake Levels \\nWater levels in the nation’s lakes can fluctuate of a short-term (e.g., seasonal) or long-term (e.g., \\nyearly basis.', 'Periods of heavy rainfall, for example, can cause high water levels for short periods \\nof time and annual snowmelt can result in higher water levels in the spring.', 'Long-term lake level \\nfluctuations are a less-recognized phenomenon that can cause high water and subsequent flooding \\nproblems lasting for years or even decades.', '———Types of Floods and Floodplains——— \\n2-15 \\nWhile all types of lakes may exhibit fluctuating water levels, they do not change dramatically in \\nlakes where outlet streams provide a fairly regular balance of inflow and outflow.', 'Some lakes, \\nhowever, are completely landlocked or have outlets that are inadequate for maintaining a balance \\nbetween inflow and outflow.', 'These lakes, commonly known as “closed basin lakes,” are \\nparticularly susceptible to dramatic fluctuations in water levels – five to fifteen feet in some \\ninstances – over long periods of time.', 'The Great Salt Lake in Utah, Devils Lake in North Dakota, \\nand the Salton Sea in California are examples of landlocked lakes, and the Great Lakes are \\nexamples of lakes with inadequate outlets under extreme high water level conditions.', 'Long-term water level fluctuations are particularly pronounced on the Great Lakes and other lakes \\nthat were formed by glacial action.', 'The significance of this problem is underscored by fact that \\nmost of the lakes in the United States are glacial lakes.', 'In the states of Alaska, Maine, Michigan, \\nMinnesota, New York, North Dakota, and Wisconsin alone, there are more than 100,000 inland \\nlakes.', 'The “playa” or drainage lakes in the West and Southwest have no outlets or only limited outlets and \\nare also subject to long-term fluctuations in water levels.', 'Sinkhole lakes in Florida and throughout \\nthe Southeast also exhibit the characteristics of closed basin lakes.', 'Flooding can be a problem on \\nthe shorelines of oxbow lakes, which are common in the floodplains of the Mississippi River, its \\ntributaries and other southern rivers.', 'Flooding caused by fluctuating lake levels presents a different set of problems than riverine \\nflooding.', 'Riverine flooding is typically of short duration, lasting for a period of hours or days.', 'While relatively short-duration flooding can also occur on lakes, flooding associated with closed-\\nbasin lakes or lakes with inadequate outlet channels may persist for years.', 'Coastal Flooding and Erosion \\nCoastal flooding and erosion are serious problems along much of the nation’s coasts, although the \\nfrequency and magnitude of flooding and the severity of the erosion vary considerably.', 'They result \\nfrom storm surges and wave actions.', 'Storm surge is the increase in water surface elevation above normal tide levels due primarily to \\nlow barometric pressure and the piling up of waters in coastal areas as a result of wind action over \\na long stretch of open water.', 'The low pressure inside a storm or hurricane’s eye creates suction like \\na straw, creating a dome of water near the center of the storm.', 'In the deep ocean, this dome of \\nwater sinks and harmlessly flows away.', 'But as a storm nears land, strong winds in the storm push \\nthis dome of water toward the shore, the rising sea floor blocks the water’s escape and it comes \\nahore as deadly storm surge.', '(See Figure 2-4.)', 'An intense hurricane can send a dome of water \\nmany miles wide and more than 25 feet deep barreling toward the shore as the storm hits land.', 'Depending upon local topography, a storm surge may inundate only a small area (such as along \\nsections of the Northeast and Northwest coasts) or may inundate coastal lands for a mile or more \\ninland from the shoreline (as in many areas of the south Atlantic and Gulf coasts).', 'Storm surge is usually estimated by subtracting the regular/astrological tide level from the observed \\nstorm tide.', 'Typical storm surge heights range from several feet to more than 25 feet.', 'The exact \\nheight of the storm surge and which coastal areas will be flooded depends on many factors, \\nincluding the strength, intensity and speed of the hurricane or storm; the direction it is moving \\nrelative to the shoreline; how rapidly the sea floor is sloping along the shore; the shape of the \\n———Types of Floods and Floodplains——— \\n2-16 \\nshoreline, and the astronomical tide.', 'In general, storm surge is most damaging when it occurs along \\na shallow sloped shoreline, during high tide, in a highly populated and developed area with little or \\nno natural buffers, such as barrier islands, coral reefs and coastal vegetation.', 'Storm surge is also \\nmost damaging in the storm’s right front quadrant because the storm, its winds and ocean waves \\nare all moving in an onshore direction due to the counter-clockwise rotation of hurricanes in the \\nNorthern Hemisphere.', 'In contrast, to the left of the eye, ocean waves and sea-level rise are moving \\ntoward the shore, but the winds are blowing in an offshore direction, thur counteracting or \\nmoderating some of the effects of the storm surge.', 'Storm surge causes sea levels to rise for a relatively short period of time (typically four to eight \\nhours, though some areas may take much longer to recede to their pre-storm levels) – often \\nresulting in extensive coastal flooding that can weaken or destroy coastal structures.', 'By temporarily \\nraising sea level, storm surge permits “dangerous and battering waves” and floating debris to \\naccess coastal areas and structures never conceived of nor built to withstand the punishing effets of \\nocean waves.', 'It is these battering waves that cause most beach erosion and extensive damage to \\ncoastal structures such as buildings, roadways, bridges, marinas, piers, boardwalks, and sea walls.', 'Figure 2-4.', 'Graphical representation of storm surge.', 'In addition to storm surge, wave action is an important aspect of coastal storms.', 'Breaking waves \\nat the shoreline become very destructive, causing damages to natural and manmade structures by \\nhydrodynamic pressure, battering solid objects and scouring sand from around foundations.', 'Components of wave action include wave set-up and wave run-up.', 'Wave set-up is the \\nsuperelevation of the water surface over normal surge elevation and is caused by onshore mass \\ntransport of the water by wave action alone.', 'Wave run-up is the action of a wave after it breaks and \\nthe water “runs up” the shoreline or other obstacle, flooding areas not reached by the storm surge \\n———Types of Floods and Floodplains——— \\n2-17 \\nitself.', 'Where vertical obstructions such as seawalls are present, wave run-up is translated into \\nupward movement of the water.', 'As waves move toward the shore, they encounter several obstacles.', 'The first obstacle is the sloping \\nbottom near the shoreline.', 'When waves reach a water depth equal to about 1.3 times the wave \\nheight, the wave breaks.', 'Breaking waves dissipate their energy by generating turbulance in the \\nwater and by transporting sediment lifted off the bottom and tossed around by the turbulent water.', 'As the turbulent water travels forward, it expends most of its remaining energy as it rushed up the \\nbeach slope.', 'The beach adjusts to changes in wave energy by changing its profile.', 'Beach material is \\nmoved either seaward, creating an offshore berm, or landward, building up the beach.', 'The beach is \\nconstantly adjusting to both wave energy and water level.', 'Offshore berms built up by the natural action of waves serve to protect the beach from most storm \\nwaves.', 'When major storms generate larger waves, the berm may be eroded and berm material \\ncarried offshore.', 'With the protective value of the berm removed, large waves can overtop the \\nbeach.', 'In severe storms such as hurricanes 50- to 100-foot wide dunes may disappear in only a \\nfew hours.', 'Although the dunes and beach may eventually recover to their previous conditions, the \\nprocess may require many years.', 'While hurricanes are the most violent type of storm and receive the most attention, serious flooding \\nand erosion problems are also caused by other coastal storms.', 'In the Atlantic, extratropical storms \\nthat develop in mid-latitudes in the fall, winter and spring occur much more frequently than tropical \\nhurricanes, and may be more than 1,000 miles in diameter, much larger than a tropical hurricane.', 'Although maximum winds are of lower velocity than tropical hurricane winds (75 miles/hr.', 'or \\ngreater), some wind gusts of hurricane velocity may occur with extratropical storms.', 'Extratropical storms that occur along the northern part of the east coast of the United States, \\naccompanied by strong winds blowing from the northeast quadrant, are called northeasters.', 'They \\nmay stall off the coast of the North Atlantic states and produce high tides that persist for several \\ndays.', 'Photograph showing damage as a consequence of a coastal storm.', '———Types of Floods and Floodplains——— \\n2-18 \\nFloodwater Damage to Structures \\nThe extent of damage to structures that come in contact with floodwaters depends on the depth of \\nthe water in and around the structure, the length of time of inundation, the toxic extent of \\ncontaminants in floodwaters, and how rapidly the water is moving.', 'Both static (little or no water \\nmovement) and dynamic (rapidly flowing water) forces are often at play.', 'In a static environment, water attacks and compromises the integrity of every part of a structure, \\nparticularly the wood foundation pilings, structural beams, carpets, wood floors, cabinetry, \\nmechanical systems, utilities, and walls.', 'Most damage to homes is sustained in the first four feet \\nabove the first floor.', 'Within this space are located the above structural components and household \\nfurnishings.', 'Floods that rise and recede quickly cause less damage than water that sits for long \\nperiods.', 'In these types of floods, the carpets, floors and drywall can be replaced, other components \\ndried out, and the remainder of the structure is likely sound.', 'Floodwaters that fill homes and other structures for weeks typically result in totally ruining \\ninteriors, i.e., replacing all of the components listed in the above paragraph.', 'The economic decision \\nis whether to demolish the structure and start over or repair what remains.', 'The dynamic forces of rapidly moving floodwater add to the above scenario.', 'As stated earlier, \\nwater flowing around and within a structure can exert great pressure on structural surfaces (e.g., \\nwater flowing at 10 mph exerts the same pressure as wind gusts of 270 mph ),4 often causing \\nfurther damage, even failure.', '“Flood water” vs. “Storm water” \\nThe floodplain management discipline is often faced with trying to distinguish between problems \\nassociated with floods and those with local drainage.', 'The distinction may be necessary in order to \\ndetermine program or agency responsibilities.', 'To the layperson, the distinction may not be really \\nimportant.', 'Whether they have 2-3 feet of “storm water” or “flood water” in their residence or \\nbusiness may make little difference.', 'They have still been flooded.', 'The following general distinctions can be made between the two: \\n∞ Flow directions in major streams \\no Flooding – water overflows the channel and moves away from the stream \\no Storm water – water runoff flows towards the channel or conveyance structure \\n∞ Size of drainage area \\no Flooding – the contributing drainage area is greater than one square mile \\no Storm water- the contributing drainage area is less than one square mile \\n∞ Nature of stream   \\no

3.1 incorporates a multiplicity of\\ninformation compared to a peak discharge at a single gauge.', 'For\\ninstance, the 82 ﬂood events include 2370 gauges having at least\\na 2-year peak discharge.',

manual\\nclassiﬁcation with the help of diagnostic maps has an advantage\\nover quantitative rules, since essential details and hydrological\\nexpert knowledge can be incorporated.', 'For the majority of events,\\nthe assumption that one ﬂood is the result of the same process, i.e.', 'each ﬂood is assigned to one ﬂood type, is revealed by the diagnostic\\nmaps.', 'However, similar to many natural phenomena, the bound-\\naries between the process types are not sharp (Merz and Blöschl,\\n2003).', 'For instance, snowmelt accompanied by rainfall in the high\\naltitudes, whereas in the lowlands merely rainfall contributes to\\nﬂood generation.', 'A second example is local rainfall embedded in\\nlarge scale synoptic systems as was the case in the Elbe ﬂood in\\nAugust 2002.', 'In these cases, the prevailing process in the entire\\nﬂood-affected catchment is identiﬁed with the help of the diagnos-\\ntic maps and the ﬂood event is assigned to the respective ﬂood type.', 'For instance, the ﬂood in August 2002 is classiﬁed as a long-rain\\nﬂood, although spatially limited high intensity rainfall (Tarolli\\net al., 2013) affected several sites in the catchment progressively\\nwithin the build-up period.', 'The identiﬁed ﬂood event set may be biased towards ﬂoods in\\nthe German part of the Elbe catchment, as only a limited number\\nof gauges were available in the Czech part of the

same weight.', 'The pattern persistence and succession within the build-up period\\nare not addressed.', 'Second, the linkage is independent of the spatial\\nﬂood extent.', 'Flood events of large spatial extent, affecting many\\nsites in the catchment, receive the same weight as more local ﬂood\\nevents.', 'Thus, patterns favouring large-scale ﬂooding are not\\noverrepresented.', 'The applied linkage ensures a clear separation between hydro-\\nlogical pre-conditions and meteorological conditions.', 'In addition, it\\ntakes into account the temporal ﬂood development of the different\\nﬂood events/types by an event speciﬁc build-up period (Fig.', '2,\\nFig.', '5).', 'Similar to our approach, Duckstein et al.', '(1993) applied sea-\\nsonal build-up periods according to seasonally varying
